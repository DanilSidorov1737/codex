# Testing procedures and evidence

## Phase 0 results

Baseline `8026444c98cd9c6db9e7c953b44a20ea4f93c7b6`; Linux x86_64 cloud host.
Rust 1.95.0; Node 24.19.0; pnpm 10.34.5.
No application source changed. Existing tests were used; no new feature tests
were written because implementation is not authorized.

Machine-local evidence is under `/workspace/.onboarding/phase0/`:
`file-search-tests.log`, `script-tests.log`, `sdk-exec-tests.log`,
`file-search-smoke.jsonl`, and final documentation checks. Logs are generated
outputs, not committed secrets or application files. Counts are summarized here
for sessions where the machine-local logs are unavailable.

Earlier onboarding built the TypeScript SDK and installed frozen dependencies.
Its full SDK suite had 18 passes and 31 failures because the full Codex binary
was missing. Phase 0 did not rerun that integration suite or call it passing.
The narrower 14-test unit run above is distinct.

Phase 0 did not build/run the full Codex CLI/TUI, install/run Neovim, invoke a
live model, trust/run upstream Ponytail hooks, run all Rust/Bazel suites, exercise
daemon crash/restore, or test 1,000 agents. Those remain implementation gates.

## Existing environment activation

From this prepared cloud environment, initialize each shell:

```bash
export CARGO_HOME=/workspace/.onboarding/cargo
export RUSTUP_HOME=/workspace/.onboarding/rustup
export npm_config_cache=/workspace/.onboarding/npm-cache
export XDG_DATA_HOME=/workspace/.onboarding/data
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/workspace/.onboarding/cache
export PATH="/workspace/.onboarding/cargo/bin:/workspace/.onboarding/pnpm/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
```

Use existing checkouts. No worktree creation is needed for environment setup.
Do not dump credential/environment values. Frozen installation is
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --store-dir /workspace/.onboarding/pnpm-store`;
Phase 0 used already installed dependencies and did not reinstall.

## Future validation layers

1. Unit/state-machine tests: task transitions, cycles, expected revisions,
   permission/grant composition, reservation arithmetic, revoked credentials,
   dirty-base/changedtick conflicts and Unicode indexing.
2. Storage/protocol integration: actual SQLite, transactions, migration/restore,
   duplicate inbox/outbox delivery, pagination/replay, schema compatibility and
   approval reissuance. Do not mock away durability or authorization boundaries.
3. Runtime integration: real app-server/daemon, existing execution adapters,
   sandbox/tool limits and fixture project tasks; inject interruptions at meaningful
   start/dispatch/persist checkpoints.
4. Real terminal/editor: actually launch the built application in a PTY/terminal,
   send keyboard commands, navigate views, change pane sizes, submit work,
   decide an approval, inspect results, and quit/reconnect. Then perform actual
   Neovim edit/save/undo/diff/follow/conflict behavior.
5. Live bounded pilot: real authorized provider request and real local artifact,
   with spending/usage recorded. Fixture models alone do not prove provider behavior.
6. Qualification: declared registry/concurrency targets, backpressure, idle
   behavior, crash/restore and platform matrix.

Use existing Rust tests/nextest, TypeScript Jest, Python unittest, PTY utilities
and meaningful fault-injection fixtures. Add a terminal driver only if existing
tools cannot exercise needed inputs; do not adopt a large UI framework merely
for screen snapshots. Snapshot tests complement, not replace, real interaction.

Choose tests for affected behavior and repository CI requirements. Do not expand
into unrelated suites once evidence is sufficient. Run formatting in check mode
for source; avoid update-snapshot/codegen commands unless the approved change
requires them.

## Interactive test recipe after implementation

- Create a temporary fixture project/state directory and record starting Git/
  filesystem state. Preserve existing user files.
- Start the real daemon with approved test settings and initialize handshake.
- Launch the actual TUI in a terminal; type real commands to define an agent,
  create/authorize a project and launch work. Record the exact supported syntax
  after implementation, not an invented Phase 0 command.
- Switch Console -> Projects -> Operations; navigate tree using keyboard; verify
  displayed owner/status against backend records.
- Enter Workspace; in actual Neovim insert text, Escape, undo, write, reopen,
  split/diff and resize. Verify disk output and dirty-buffer rejection.
- Enter Review, inspect current artifact/test evidence, reject/reapprove as
  authorized. Detach TUI while work runs and reconnect.
- Kill/restart only the fixture daemon and test safe attempt/approval/reservation
  recovery. Restore a fixture backup and compare canonical records.
- Capture failures, fix approved implementation/setup, rerun affected checks,
  and record any unsupported scenarios. Do not mark incomplete behavior done.

## Evidence record template

For each task/commit record: commit SHA, OS/architecture/tool versions, provider
and permissions scope (no secrets), fixture/input, exact command and directory,
exit code, test counts (passed/failed/skipped/unrun), interaction keys and observed
behavior, artifact/log path plus hash, failure diagnosis, rerun result and limitation.
Tie results to the current artifact revision. Mocked, manual, live and synthetic
evidence must be distinguishable.
